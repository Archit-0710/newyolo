def emojis(str=""):

    Returns an emoji-safe version of a string, stripped of emojis on Windows platforms.

    Args:
        str (str): Input string that may contain emojis.

    Returns:
        str: A version of the input string with emojis removed if the platform is Windows, otherwise the original string
            is returned unmodified.

    Notes:
        - This function is particularly useful for ensuring compatibility with systems or applications where emoji
          display might be problematic, such as certain Windows platforms.

    Examples:
        ```python
        safe_str = emojis("Hello üåç")
        print(safe_str)  # On Windows: "Hello ", on other platforms: "Hello üåç"

        Initializes TryExcept with an optional message, providing a context manager and decorator for error handling.

        Args:
            msg (str): Optional. A message to display on exception. Default is an empty string.

        Returns:
            None

        Notes:
            The `TryExcept` class can be used as a decorator or with a context manager to encapsulate code blocks for error handling.
            It is particularly useful when you want to ensure that your code keeps running smoothly by catching and managing exceptions.

        Examples:
            Using `TryExcept` as a decorator:
            ```python
            @TryExcept(msg="Error occurred")
            def some_function():
                # Function code
            ```

            Using `TryExcept` as a context manager:
            ```python
            with TryExcept(msg="Error in context"):
                # Code block
            ```

    def __enter__(self):
        """
        Enter the runtime context related to this object for error handling with an optional message.

        Returns:
            TryExcept: The context manager instance for error handling.

        Examples:
            Usage as a context manager:
            ```python
            with TryExcept("An error occurred"):
                # Your code block here
                pass

            @TryExcept("An error occurred")
            def your_function():
                # Your code block here

        """
        Context manager exit method that handles exceptions, prints an emoji-safe error message if an exception
        occurred, and always suppresses the exception.

            exc_type (type | None): The exception type, if an exception was raised.
            value (Exception | None): The exception instance, if an exception was raised.
            traceback (traceback | None): The traceback object, if an exception was raised.

        Returns:
